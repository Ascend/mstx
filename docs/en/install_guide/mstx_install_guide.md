# MindStudio Tools Extension Library Installation Guide

## 1. Installation Notes

This tool is integrated into CANN. If CANN is already installed and you do not need to update this tool, you can use it directly without following the installation steps in this document.

If CANN is not yet installed in your environment, refer to the [CANN Quick Installation](https://www.hiascend.com/en/cann/download) guide to install the Ascend NPU driver and CANN software (including Toolkit and the ops package), and configure the environment variables.

If you need to upgrade this tool separately or use the latest version, you can install it in the following three ways: [online installation](#21-online-installation), [offline installation](#22-offline-installation), [source installation](#23-source-installation).

## 2. Installation Methods

### 2.1 Online Installation

If your device has internet access, you can automatically download and install the tool with a single command. Please visit the Ascend Community MindStudio [download](https://www.hiascend.com/en/developer/software/mindstudio/download) page, select the corresponding CANN version, and choose online installation as the installation method. The system will guide you through the subsequent operations.

### 2.2 Offline Installation

For devices in environments without external network access, such as enterprise intranets, first download the complete offline installation package on a machine with internet access, then transfer it to the target device for installation. Please visit the MindStudio [download](https://www.hiascend.com/en/developer/software/mindstudio/download) page on the Ascend Community, select the corresponding CANN version, choose offline installation as the installation method, and obtain the corresponding installation package and operation guide.

### 2.3 Source Installation

If you need to use the latest code features or modify the source code to enhance functionality, you can download the repository code, compile and package the tool yourself, and complete the installation.

    ```sh

    yum install python3-devel
    ```

  - Ubuntu environment:

    ```sh

    ```

    NOTE: Non-root users need to add sudo before the command, for example: `sudo yum install python3-devel`.

You can uninstall it by following these steps:

1. Download the script.

   ```bash
   curl -O https://inst.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/26.0.0/ms_install.py
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - An internet connection is required for downloading. If the environment does not allow internet access or is offline, please download the script in an environment with internet access first, and then copy it to the target device.
   > - If the command does not respond or issues such as connection failure or SSL certificate errors occur, please refer to [FAQ](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/blog/details/02176213671719317003).

2. Execute the uninstallation.

   ```bash
   python ms_install.py uninstall {tools_name}
   ```

   Where `{tools_name}` refers to the name of the tool to be uninstalled. You can query it using the `python ms_install.py help` command, and the tool name will be displayed under the Available Tools field in the printed information.

   If the uninstallation is successful, the following information is printed:

   ```text
   Successfully uninstalled 1 tool ({tools_name})
   ```

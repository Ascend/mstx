## ✨ What's New

<span style="font-size:14px;">

🔹 **[Dec 31, 2025]**: The MindStudio Tools Extension Library project is now fully open source.

</span>

## ℹ️ Introduction

MindStudio Tools Extension Library (msTX) introduces the msTX instrumentation API. It allows you to customize collection time ranges or the start and end time points of key functions, identify information such as key functions or iterations, and quickly scope performance and operator issues.

## ⚙️ Features

By default, the mstx API has no functionality. You need to call the mstx API in your user application and then enable the mstx instrumentation feature for different scenarios, such as configuring `--mstx=on` when profiling data with the msprof CLI, configuring `ACL_PROF_MSPROFTX` when profiling data with the AscendCL API, and configuring `mstx=True` when profiling data with the Ascend PyTorch Profiler API.

## 🌌 Smart Search

To improve documentation search efficiency, we provide multiple efficient search methods:  
🔹 [AI Q&A (DeepWiki)](https://deepwiki.com/mindstudio-docs/master): Natural language Q&A to quickly grasp the project architecture and module relationships.   
🔹 [AI Q&A (ZRead)](https://zread.ai/mindstudio-docs/master): Better Chinese Q&A experience for precisely locating feature usage and details.   
🔹 [Precise Search (ReadTheDocs)](https://mindstudio-operator-tools-docs.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/): Full-text keyword search that takes you directly to APIs, parameters, error messages, and more.  

## 📦 Installation Guide
